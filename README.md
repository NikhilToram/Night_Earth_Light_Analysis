# Nighttime Earth-light Analysis
Analyzing and Exploring Night VIIRS Satellite's nighttime Light data's connection with economic activity.


**Hypothesis:**

1. There is a significant positive correlation between the economic activity of a region and an increase in the night light brightness of human settlements.
3. There is a dip in night light brightness during the coronavirus pandemic period in various countries.

 

**Research questions:**

1. Can we identify rapidly growing economic clusters using night light data?

2. Can we identify activities in protected ecological areas?

**Initializing the project:**
After loading the project to your IDE. Refer to the instruction in the "initialize the dataset.ipynb" to get started.
